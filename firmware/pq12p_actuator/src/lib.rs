//! High-level driver for an Actuonix PQ12-P linear actuator driven by a TI DRV8876 H-bridge,
//! built on top of `embassy-stm32` for `no_std` environments.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! This crate provides two actuator abstractions for the PQ12-P + DRV8876 combination:
//!
//! - [`Pq12P`] – uses *dual-PWM* drive (DRV8876 in 2×PWM mode, `IN1`/`IN2` both PWM-capable).
//!   Exposes explicit `coast`, `brake`, `move_out`, and `move_in` helpers, plus current sensing
//!   via the DRV8876 IPROPI pin.
//!
//! Both drivers are generic over `embassy-stm32` peripheral instances:
//!
//! - PWM: [`SimplePwmChannel`] on a [`GeneralInstance4Channel`] timer.
//! - ADC: [`Adc`] with [`AnyAdcChannel`] for position and/or current feedback.
//!
//! # Hardware assumptions
//!
//! - DRV8876 is wired in either:
//!   - 2×PWM mode (`IN1`/`IN2` both driven by timers), or
//!   - 1×PWM + direction GPIO mode.
//! - `nSLEEP` is held high during normal operation.
//! - ADC reference is 3.3 V and 12-bit (0–4095), matching `ADC_VREF` and `ADC_MAX_RAW`.
//! - The PQ12-P feedback pin is connected to an ADC channel, and (for [`Pq12P`]) the DRV8876
//! - The PQ12-P feedback reference voltages are 3V3 for P+ and GND for P-
//! - DRV8876 IPROPI pin is also connected to an ADC channel if current measurement is desired.
//!
//! TODO:
//! - [`SimplePq12P`] – uses a *single PWM* output plus a direction GPIO. Provides simple
//!   open-loop speed control and basic position feedback using the PQ12-P’s internal potentiometer,
//!   including a blocking [`SimplePq12P::move_to_pos`] primitive in millimeters.
